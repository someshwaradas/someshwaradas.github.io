A town that defies gravity and expectation. It\u2019s perched precariously on the mountain slopes east of Cottonwood, and on your first visit you\u2019ll know that this ghostly town has a story to tell, one that dances between the shadows and the light.</p> <p>I\u2019ve since learned that Jerome was once a thriving copper mining hub, and its history is etched in the rock it clings to. In its heyday, it echoed with the clinking of pickaxes and the clang of smelting, but now it reverberates with the whispers of a bygone era. A town with a past, present, and future, all intertwined like the veins of copper deep underground. Uncovering its history is worth every moment you spend there.</p> <p>When staying in Jerome, each dawn awakens a tapestry of colors as the sun paints the mountains with the typical desert hues, transforming the town into a living canvas. The view from the Jerome Grand Hotel, once a hospital for miners, offers a glimpse into the majesty of this rustic place. You can almost hear the whispers of miners long past, echoing through the hallways.</p> <p>Morning walks through Jerome's narrow, winding streets, are a treat. You'll find a Bohemian spirit that defies conformity. There are art galleries, boutique shops, and small caf\u00e9s, which all breathe life into the town\u2019s old bones. The spirit of creativity is alive here, as local artists pay homage to the town's wild past through their work.</p> <p>Night is a different vibe altogether. In the darkness of night, Jerome embraces the shadows, becoming a labyrinth of secrets. The town also takes on an otherworldly feel as night falls, with the eerie glow of antique street-lamps that cast long, haunting shadows on the cobblestone streets. You must check out the cemetery, a resting place for those who worked and perished in the copper mines. It's a sobering reminder of the town's dark and dangerous past, a place where tales of the departed come to life in the imaginations of those who walk the paths between the tombstones.</p> <p>To me, Jerome is a paradox. It stands at the crossroads of history and innovation, where the past whispers and the present listens. It's a place of beauty and mystery, where the copper veins of its past still run deep, and the spirits of those who once called it home continue to linger. Not only that, but it's a town that defies gravity and captivates the soul, where shadows and light coexist in a dance as timeless as the mountains. Experience Jerome once in your life, and you\u2019ll be better for it.</p>","tags":["travel","nomadic-lifestyle"]},{"location":"features/","title":"DEV-Test","text":""},{"location":"features/#admonitions","title":"Admonitions","text":""},{"location":"features/#standard","title":"Standard","text":"<p>Important Note</p> <p>This is a test of the note feature.</p>"},{"location":"features/#collapsable","title":"Collapsable","text":"Collapsable Note <p>This note can colapse on the page.</p>"},{"location":"features/#inline","title":"Inline","text":"<p>Inline Note</p> <p>This is an inline note which is right justified.</p> <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

I read chapter one again. I finished around 12:30 AM and had the following thought:</p> <p>Illusion is generally accepted to mean a misleading, false, or deceptive state. Unfortunately, due to the way the concept is presented, coupled with my western way of thinking about non-physical things, I have come to believe that the world is the deceiver, and not the one who perceives the world. This could be due to my past exploration of Buddhist philosophy, mostly from western thinkers. I\u2019ve been misunderstanding Maya in the same way.</p> <p>Suddenly, I have this flash of insight: Maya veils the unity of existence and causes us to experience duality.

Should be up soon.</p>"},{"location":"varanasi/","title":"The Road to Varanasi","text":"<p>Instead of the usual bio, I think I\u2019ll tell you a little story about how my present incarnation came to be.</p> <p>I'm sitting in my favorite camping chair in the desert. The air is cooling as the sun begins its slow descent into darkness. I hear the distant howling of coyotes, relentless and piercing as if to cheer on M\u0105\u02bcii to once again create a mess of the Milky Way, much to the chagrin of the Black God.</p> <p>Life is good. I have a great home, a loving family, a fantastic job that pays me well, so I can afford these little off-road trysts with nature, and a sense of well-being better than I could ever imagine navigating through my younger years. Everything is perfect.</p> <p>Until now.</p> <p>Suddenly, I have this intense feeling of floating. I can't feel the chair. I'm slightly disoriented and mildly nauseous. Everything feels strange. I look at my hands and then my legs; they feel like they're part of someone else. I started to breathe heavily, and that is a good sign. At least I know I'm still alive.</p> <p>Then it happened. I looked at the sky, but I wasn't looking at it. I was the sky. It's hard to explain, but I couldn't discern the difference between me and what I was looking at. Everything I saw was not separate from me. I was expanding at an incredible rate, moving outward with greater and greater intensity. Everything encompassed in this expanding awareness was me! For a brief moment, I thought I had died, and the resulting fear gripped me and brought everything back to the meager boundaries of my body. It was over.</p> <p>I sat up, breathing heavily and quickly. My face was wet, and I quickly discovered I was sweating. Every part of me felt like it had electricity running through it. My muscles ached, and my back hurt. I got up, shaking a bit, and started walking toward my Jeep to get my phone. I needed to call someone and get a lifeline back to reality. </p> <p>I tripped on a small rock and almost fell. That is when I realized it was pitch black.</p> <p>\"Man, the sun sets quickly,\" I thought. \"What time is it?\"</p> <p>Thankfully, my Jeep wasn't far away. I opened the door and retrieved my phone. I pressed the button, and the screen lit up. In big white numbers was the time: 2:37 AM. I had been sitting there for over five hours! I quickly grabbed my notebook and wrote everything down.  Everything. In great detail. Luckily, years of journaling prepared me to get the details right for future reference. I forgot all about calling anyone. I was completely immersed in trying to unravel what happened.</p> <p>The remainder of the camping trip was uneventful, and I had no more (whatever that was) experiences. I tried to put it out of my mind, but something like that you don't quickly forget. When I returned home, I was determined to figure out what had happened in the desert. My initial reaction was to search for a medical reason. Looking through many online articles describing illnesses with symptoms similar to what I experienced, I could find nothing remotely concrete to latch onto. There was only one way to find out if the issue was medical: to schedule an appointment with my doctor.</p> <p>Well, that was a mistake. I was quickly funneled over to a psychologist after being told that it was unlikely a medical issue would cause it. However, in a welcome stroke of luck, the psychologist suggested we run some tests to rule out a medical condition. I agreed. The appointment was scheduled for the week after next.</p> <p>Two days later, I had another experience. This time it was just as I was starting to pass from waking to sleep. I was pulled back into semi-consciousness. My internal field of vision was yellow, not bright yellow, but a more subdued but rich yellow color. An image of a desk, not a full desk, but a smaller desk, possibly 2' wide with a single drawer in front, was positioned isometrically facing forward and to the left. It faded and was replaced by the image of a bald man, clean-shaven, facing the same forward and left view as the desk. Another smaller face appeared to the right of his head facing forward, possibly dark bearded with long dark hair, and then both heads faded away.</p> <p>A grid appeared. Lattices, but the lines were thick and very dark black. Within each diamond-shaped space were symbols, dark and black, as ink drawings. The first was a three-pronged instrument, much like the trident you see in Greek myths. I then saw a hand in a strange position from the wrist up. Finally, other symbols I needed help distinguishing. Each diamond rotated between them: first, the three-pronged symbol, then the hand, and then a symbol. The unknown symbols were different each time. Each diamond space rotated the symbols at different times and different speeds.</p> <p>The imagery felt more real than reality, and I came out of the waking-dreaming cusp and slowly opened my eyes. The imagery was gone, and I saw only my dark bedroom. I closed my eyes and fell asleep almost immediately.</p> <p>I woke up at about 1:15 AM thinking about it, but quickly fell asleep again until my normal waking time.</p> <p>The next day, the wait for the tests became even more painful. I thought about it every waking moment, hoping I didn't have some awful condition that would plague me for the rest of my life. I barely slept. I lost interest in watching television or reading. I rarely got together with friends, preferring to be alone. All I wanted was answers.</p> <p>But no answers came. All the tests were normal. I met with the psychologist several times over the following few weeks, but it was clear that nothing physical, emotional, or mental was the issue. I was almost out of options.</p> <p>Except one, and the one I would rather not admit: the spiritual one.</p> <p>Up to this point, I'd always been somewhat spiritual. I felt there was a higher power and explored various spiritual practices, but nothing stuck. I saw through them as light passed through a screen on the way to its destination\u2014a minor distraction. I grew up Christian, which provided no answers, probably because I'd given up on that path long ago. Non-dual philosophies provided some comfort, but the underlying rules and regulations made them seem more like man-made constructs and not inspired by a creator.</p> <p>Around this time, a friend who was intensely dedicated to his spiritual path told me he was going to India and wanted to know if I was interested in joining him. He knew about my experience and inability to understand what was happening, and I think he was trying to be helpful. I had a significant amount of vacation time, so I agreed. He said we were off to Varanasi, one of the holiest places in India and one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. This intrigued me, and I might find some answers there, and it seemed like a good place to start.</p> <p>When we arrived in Varanasi, I was first struck by the sheer chaos of the place. Everything was moving, and people were everywhere. It seemed nothing made sense, and at the same time, it made perfect sense. My friend explained that in Varanasi, you must let go and let things flow like water; otherwise, you'll drive yourself crazy. Still, it was sensory overload multiplied by a thousand!</p> <p>We were headed down toward the river to the ghats, which are steps down to the Ganges river. As we turned onto a small alley, I saw it. Painted on a wall was the three-pronged symbol I had seen in my waking-dreaming state. In that same area was a small alcove with a makeshift tent, and some people were inside. As we walked past it, I saw all of it: the small desk, the bald man, and the bearded man with dark hair. I thought I was going to throw up. I froze. My friend asked me what was wrong, and I told him about the vision and how it matched the scene inside the tent. He brushed it off, saying, \"It's probably just a coincidence.\" </p> <p>We kept walking, but in my mind, I knew I was coming back to that tent at some point before we left Varanasi. It is the most likely place to start looking for answers.</p> <p>My friend decided to return to The States early, as luck (or synchronicity) would have it. He did not find what he was looking for and wouldn't talk about it, except at a very superficial level. I was frustrated with his decision, but deep down, I understood his decision. This was a problem because it would leave me alone in a place I had not been to before and needed experience navigating. Against my initial reaction to go with him, I decided to stay. I wanted to speak with the men in the tent. It felt urgent.</p> <p>The next day, my friend left, and I was alone. I immediately made a b-line for the tent I had seen, and to my surprise, it was gone! I thought I had wandered into the wrong alley, but everything else matched where we had been a few days earlier. Defeated, I walked back to the ghats to clear my head near the river. Not knowing what I should do, I just sat.</p> <p>Many hours later, the sun started to set, and I wandered along the ghats, thinking about what to do next. Ahead of me, I noticed a tent, and the cloths covering it were similar to the tent I saw in the alley. I started walking faster and faster, racing with the sun to reach it before that area was covered in shadow. I arrived just as the sun was setting. There were various small lights in the tent, and I could see inside.</p> <p>Inside the tent was an older man with a long white beard. He motioned for me to come inside. To my surprise, he spoke decent English. I introduced myself, and he said hello, but did not tell me his name. We sat in awkward silence for a moment, and then he spoke.</p> <p>\"Are you visiting or passing through?\"</p> <p>\"Visiting,\" I said.</p> <p>\"Most from the United States are looking for something. Are you?\"</p> <p>\"Yes,\" I said and leaned forward, and he looked me right in the eyes.</p> <p>\"Come sit by me.\"</p> <p>I was a bit freaked out at this point, but I went and sat next to him, and for a person who lives in a tent on a dirty stone platform, he seemed relatively well-groomed and clean. I did not feel uncomfortable being near him. He put his hand in a bowl of what looked like powder, took some between his fingers, and wiped it on my forehead. He did this a few times. The last time the powder was red, it smelled like some fragrant herb or spice. He then placed the palm of his hand on my chest, and the electricity I experienced during my first experience was back.</p> <p>It was not the same as before, however. It was intense. I was shaking. For some reason, I began to tell him everything that happened, from that first time in the desert to the tent in the alley. He listened but said nothing. I must have talked for an hour. At least it felt like an hour. After I finished, we sat in silence for quite some time. Finally, he spoke.</p> <p>\"You have found Shiva.\"</p> <p>My mind started racing. I was picturing all the things I read about him, all the strange stories of this god Shiva. It all seemed like mythology to me, stories conjured up by people, just like the Christian beliefs I learned growing up. My thoughts were spinning, and I was going further and further down a rabbit hole I was creating in my head.</p> <p>He slapped me on the leg and said, \"Not that Shiva!\"</p> <p>He laughed. I laughed. I didn\u2019t know why.</p> <p>For some time, we talked, and he told me of this belief with no rules, structures, or dogmas. He told me about the holy books about this belief and why I should read them. He helped me understand why I had these experiences and what they meant. Then he sent me away, and I never saw him again. He set me on a path that I follow to this day. Gurus do come in strange packages if I do say so myself.</p> <p>When I returned to The States, I started reading. Some books were more challenging to obtain than others, but I found them all. I discovered a set of beliefs that are collectively known as Shaivism, or more specifically, Kashmir Shaivism. I learned that to understand Shiva is to understand consciousness. I learned that there is no right way or wrong way. If your devotion to realizing you are Shiva is genuine, that's all that matters. I learned that we are all the universe, experiencing itself, and there is nothing to fear.</p> <p>There really is nothing to fear, and this is precisely where my journey began.</p> <p>Now, in my sixty-fourth year of life, I find myself retired and traveling the world, experiencing everything this incarnation has to offer. I travel back to India periodically to meet with my guru, and his instruction is clear: you must serve people. And by serve, he means teach.</p> <p>He once said to me, \u201cSoma, you are a terrible follower, an unconvincing leader, but you are a good teacher. Teach, and teach by telling your story.\u201d</p> <p>So begins the task of writing it all down in hopes someone else can benefit from what I\u2019ve learned.</p>","tags":["spirituality","spiritual-experience"]},{"location":"whypython/","title":"Why Python?","text":"<p>Coming soon...</p>"},{"location":"tags/","title":"Find By Tags","text":"<p>The following is a list of content grouped by tags.
